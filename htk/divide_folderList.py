# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% DESCRIPTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# 
# This script generate as much txt files as cores are required. Within each .txt file a subset of the entire folder list
# is reported.
# Main functions:
# 	- Divide in the list of folder names in different sub-lists, which are stored in different .txt files
#	- Those sub-lists are then used by speechTester.sh and htk_cross_val.py
#
# Note: this script doesnÂ´t have to be manipulated by the user.
# 
# Is called by: speech_Tester.sh
